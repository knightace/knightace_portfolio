<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Johnny English Reborn</h3>
<p>The movie is very interesting especially the acting of Rowan Atkinson and the way he plays his Role as MI7 Agent. Some of the Scenes that were really funny were
    when he visited Pudovkin for Golf Game, the time when he finds the Chinese Killer and that Dialog was very funny where they find out that there is a Mole in MI7.
</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The Movie is based on Space and exhibits very interesting concepts regarding Space, the Worm holes and the relation of time w.r.t Gravity.</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>The movie is one of the best Action Movies. A movie which when being produced was just an average movie, later on broke the Records. The interesting thing is that every action Scene
    in that movie is based on one Scene. The movie was so successful that 4 parts have been produced till now and the latest Movie named Chapter 4 is released in May 2023.
